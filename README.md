Android Architecture Components Basic Sample
=============================================

This sample showcases the following Architecture Components:

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
* [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ViewModel.html)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LiveData.html)
* [RxJava-RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)

Introduction

### Features

This sample contains two screens: a login view and a home view.

The app uses a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for the presentation layer. Each of the fragments corresponds to a MVVM View. The View and ViewModel communicate  using LiveData and the following design principles:

* ViewModel objects don't have references to activities, fragments, or Android views. That would cause leaks on configuration changes, such as a screen rotation, because the system retains a ViewModel across the entire lifecycle of the corresponding view.

* ViewModel objects expose data using `LiveData` objects. `LiveData` allows you to observe changes to data across multiple components of your app without creating explicit and rigid dependency paths between them.

* Views, including the fragments used in this sample, subscribe to corresponding `LiveData` objects. Because `LiveData` is lifecycle-aware, it doesn’t push changes to the underlying data if the observer is not in an active state, and this helps to avoid many common bugs. This is an example of a subscription:

```java
        // Update the list of products when the underlying data changes.
        viewModel.getProducts().observe(this, new Observer<List<ProductEntity>>() {
            @Override
            public void onChanged(@Nullable List<ProductEntity> myProducts) {
                if (myProducts != null) {
                    mBinding.setIsLoading(false);
                    mProductAdapter.setProductList(myProducts);
                } else {
                    mBinding.setIsLoading(true);
                }
            }
        });
```
